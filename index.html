                            <p > I am an educator and web developer currently living in San Diego, California. I have spent several of the past years 
                                teaching and learning from my students. Having recently moved to California after living in Hawaii for many years, I have decided to take
                                advantage of the many opportunities this city has to offer and immerse myself in the tech world. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                                <p>
                                  I am passionate about education and hope to use my skills in technology to improve the field. Currently using several different
                                  programming languages and always looking to add to my toolbox. My experience in the classroom has caused me to believe that integrating technology into the learning process will improve education. 
                                  I believe that building bridges between the world of technology and education will lead to a more engaged student population, equipped with the skills and knowledge to tackle society’s most difficult problems.
